Networks Assignment 1

This is the first assignment for our networking class. Our task was to implement a virtual post it board through a client and a multithreaded server application that can communicate with each other. Using the client users should be able to post notes on the board, get notes on the board, pin/unpin notes and clear notes.

Future CP372 students you're welcome.
